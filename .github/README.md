- **Efficient Serialization**: Advanced serialization techniques to save and load game states efficiently.
- **Comprehensive Input Management**: Robust input handling for various devices.
- **Advanced Graphics Rendering**: High-quality graphics rendering capabilities.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Input**: Handles user input from various devices.
- **Serialization**: Manages efficient serialization and deserialization of game objects.
- **Objects**: Contains core game objects and entities.
- **Units**: Manages game units and their interactions.
- **System**: Core system functionalities and utilities.
- **GameEngine**: Main engine classes and logic.
- **States**: Manages different game states.
- **Level**: Handles level data and management.
- **Graphics**: Graphics rendering and related utilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

### Installation

To install and use this engine, you can make use of the starter-kit found [here](https://github.com/transmute-games/transmute-starter).

## Usage

### Input Management

The `Input` package provides classes for handling user input from different devices. Customize and extend these classes to fit your game's input requirements.

### Serialization

The `Serialization` package includes classes for serializing and deserializing game objects. Use these classes to save and load game states efficiently.

### Graphics Rendering

The `Graphics` package offers classes and utilities for advanced graphics rendering. Customize these to enhance the visual aspects of your game.

### Game States

The `States` package manages various game states such as menus, gameplay, and pause states. Extend these classes to implement your game's state management logic.

### Level Management

The `Level` package contains classes for managing game levels and related data. Use these classes to load, save, and manage levels in your game.
